## Line-Follower
This is a basic line follower robot. It runs on a track with a black line and white background.
Also the robot needs some time to calibrate when turned on.
To make calibration succesfull, you have to expose the sensors to all values(e.g the black line and white background).
When turned on, calibration takes 10 seconds. After that the robot starts following the line.


## Current Status
For now, the project is still under development.
